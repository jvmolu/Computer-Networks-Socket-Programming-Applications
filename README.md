Welcome to the networking playground! ðŸš€ Dive into the fascinating world of Computer Networks with our GitHub repository, aptly named "Networking-Playground."

What's inside? Brace yourself for an exhilarating journey:

**UDP Client Server Simulation:** Ever wanted to experience the unpredictability of real-world networks? Our simulation includes random packet loss, allowing you to calculate metrics like Round-Trip Time (RTT) while navigating through the twists and turns of network traffic.

**Dynamic UDP Client Server:** Take it up a notch with a simulation akin to the powerful iperf application. Watch as the client sends packets at decreasing intervals, mimicking real-world scenarios and testing the limits of network performance.

**TCP-Based Marvels:** Need to transfer files or communicate between processes? We've got you covered with two TCP-based applications. Experience seamless file transfers and efficient inter-process communication with just a few lines of code.

**Versatile TCP Client Server:** Our TCP simulation supports both IPV4 and IPV6 addresses, ensuring compatibility and flexibility in your networking endeavors.

Whether you're a seasoned networking enthusiast or just dipping your toes into the vast ocean of computer networks, our repository offers a welcoming space to explore, experiment, and elevate your skills. Join us, and let's embark on a thrilling adventure through the interconnected realms of bytes and packets! ðŸ’»âœ¨
